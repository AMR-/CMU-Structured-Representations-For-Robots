# CMU-Structured-Representations-For-Robots
Code to go along with the Master's Thesis "Structured Representations for Behaviors of Autonomous Robots" by Aaron M. Roth

The Master's Thesis can be cited as followss:

    @mastersthesis{Roth-2019-117131,
    author = {Aaron Roth},
    title = {Structured Representations for Behaviors of Autonomous Robots},
    year = {2019},
    month = {July},
    school = {Carnegie Mellon University},
    address = {Pittsburgh, PA},
    number = {CMU-RI-TR-19-50},
    keywords = {Artificial Intelligence, Explainable Artificial Intelligence, Human Robot Interaction, Reinforcement Learning, Decision Trees, Robotics Frameworks, Instruction Graph, Learning by Instruction},
    }

In the **Interactive_TAIG** folder, find sample code for the Interactive TAIG demonstration.

In the **RobotNavigation** folder, find code for the OpenAI compatible RobotNavigation environment.

RobotNavigation requires the following pip packages:

    gym 0.12.1+
    numpy 1.16.3+
    Pillow 6.0.0+

Robot Navigation A can be instantiated with

```python
env = RobotNavEnv(random_hole_pos=False, is_state_cart=False, include_stage_boolean=False)
```

Robot Navigation B can be instantiated with

```python
env = RobotNavEnv(random_hole_pos=False, is_state_cart=True, include_stage_boolean=True)
```

If you use RobotNavigation in a project, please cite the following papers (bibtex found below):
